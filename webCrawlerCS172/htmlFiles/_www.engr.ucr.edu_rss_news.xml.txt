     <link>http://www.engr.ucr.edu/news/2014/2014-11-4.html 
     <description>
      With the support of his third Gates Foundation Challenge grant, Eamonn Keogh and a team of interdisciplinary researchers will test their creative method of encouraging healthy behavior by using smartphone technology, game theory, incentive models, and anthropology. Conducting initial experiments with volunteers in the developed world-- then moving to thornier problems in third world communities--the team will use the 'PEG' system affectionately named after Keogh's late mother, Peggy "Peg" Keogh.

     <link>http://www.engr.ucr.edu/news/2014/2014-09-12.html 
     <description>
      A team of engineering students has developed an inexpensive, versatile pad that can be inserted into diapers to detect dehydration and bacterial infections in infants. The product, which recently won an award that included a $10,000 prize at a national engineering design contest, operates much like a home pregnancy test or urine test strip.
